## Project 1: Shot Selection & Efficiency Analysis
**Author:** [Il Tuo Nome] - Economics & Finance Student @ UniBo
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NBA API

### Objective
To analyze the correlation between shot location and offensive efficiency, visualizing the "Moreyball" philosophy (maximizing 3-pointers and shots at the rim) through spatial data.

### Key Findings
Using Stephen Curry (2023-24 season) as a case study:
1.  **Barbell Strategy:** The shot chart visualizes a clear polarization of attempts at the rim and beyond the arc.
2.  **Mid-Range Avoidance:** The "dead zone" (long 2s) shows minimal activity, confirming high-efficiency shot selection optimization.
